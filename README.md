- What are valid ways to represent a one-to-one relationship with the document model in MongoDB?
- create an ERD / CRD diagram for a blog application
- create and design schema for each collection
- Write a requirement document for designing a system like LinkedIn.
- Estimate daily read and writes, users, data transfer, list down all assumptions you have made
- Write down some queries ( no need to write actual queries, but the kind of information that users, and admins would like to see ). for example: - list 10 post by user_id with pagination descending order of date
